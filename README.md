# Personal Development App Disclaimer
---
I made this app secure to the best of my abilities. Each user has a unique ID generated for them when they sign up.

That being said, there is a risk you take when using this app. There is a possibility that if someone somehow knew the URL to type in and your unique generated user ID, they could access all your inputted info. Your password is the one thing that is the most secure. It would be hard for anyone to access.

I have access to the database all your goals are stored in. I will not look at the contents. I will also not delete any contents unless you ask me to do so. Be warned: if I hear that you are misusing, or trying to hack or deface this app, your account will be disabled. Your data will not be deleted and can still be requested by you, but you will not be able to login to view or change it.\n\nIf you accept these terms, you may continue to log in or sign up for an account to use this app.
