# Personal Development Privacy Statement
---
I made this app secure to the best of my abilities. Each user has a unique ID generated for them when they sign up. I set up code to protect them so no one but you can access your data.

I have access to the database all your goals are stored in. I will not look at the contents. I will also not delete any contents unless you ask me to do so. Be warned: if I hear that you are misusing, or trying to hack or deface this app, your account will be disabled. Your data will not be deleted and can still be requested by you, but you will not be able to login to view or change it.

If you accept these terms, you may continue to log in or sign up for an account to use this app.
